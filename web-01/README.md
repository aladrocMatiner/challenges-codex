# Writeup - Web Flag (Beginner Friendly)

You’re doing great already. This one is a gentle intro to web challenges. Take it step by step and enjoy the tiny wins.

## Goal
Open the web page and find the flag.

## Step 1: Open the URL
Use the connection info from the platform. It will look like this:

```
http://<HOST>:<PORT>
```

Open it in your browser. If the page looks simple, that’s expected.

## Step 2: Look at the Page (and the Source)
Start with the visible page content. The flag might already be there.

If you don’t see it right away, view the page source:
- Right click → “View Page Source”, or
- Press `Ctrl+U`

Search for `flag{`.

## Tip
Small web challenges often hide the flag in plain text. You’re not missing anything—just look carefully.

## Recap
1. Open the URL
2. Check page content
3. Check page source
4. Submit the flag

You’ve got this. Web challenges are a great place to build confidence.
