# Writeup - Web 01 (View Source)

You’ve got this. This is a gentle web challenge that teaches one core habit: always check the page source.

## Goal
Find the flag hidden in the HTML source.

## Steps
1. Open the URL shown in the challenge.
2. Right‑click → **View Page Source** (or press `Ctrl+U`).
3. Search for `flag{`.

## Why This Matters
Many real bugs and clues live *behind* the UI. Looking at source is a fast, powerful habit.

## Recap
- Open URL
- View source
- Copy the flag

Nice work — this is a classic and very useful technique.
